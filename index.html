                Chris moved to Austin, TX from a small town in northern Arkansas in 2011 for the vast opportunites available. Since moving
                to Austin, he has met the love of his life (and married her!), bought a house, and enjoys building a life
                with his two dogs and wife. </br>
                </br>His hobbies include cycling around the Austin area with friends, going on walks with his wife and dogs, and
                working on multiple house projects that seem to arise out of thin air!
